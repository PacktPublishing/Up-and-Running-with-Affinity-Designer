## Get to Know the Author
**Kevin House**
aka Kevin Creative is an award-winning design and illustration studio located on the west coast of Canada. Before becoming a freelance designer and illustrator I spent a few years in advertising agencies and design studios as graphic designer. Those demanding, creatively fruitful years gave me the experience and confidence to set up my freelance business in 2006. Today my clients are small to mid-sized creative studios and my focus is illustration and logo design. Since 2014 I have been using Affinity Designer almost exclusively for my 2d illustration work and I love the ease of use and array of creative options it brings to the table.
